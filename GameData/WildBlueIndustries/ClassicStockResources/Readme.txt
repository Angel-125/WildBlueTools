Classic Stock: A resource system for KSP

Created by Angel-125 and JadeOfMaar

Back in KSP 0.19, developers NovaSilisko and HarvesteR proposed a resource system that included Propellium, Oxium, Nitronite, Water, Blutonium, Hexagen, and Zeonium that ultimately converted into the resources we know today as LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant, and XenonGas. You can see their concept image here: i.imgur.com/08hdJyj.png Classic Stock is inspired by their vision and adds some additional resources for use in your converters and storage containers. For examples of its use, mods by Wild Blue Industries make extensive use of the Classic Stock resource system.
